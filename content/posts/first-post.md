### Introduction

This is my first post written in Markdown, I heard Hugo was super **fast** with rendering, so I want to try using it to create a personal site!

I really like fast, efficient software! I really like the concept of Files over Applications!
So having all my site content as plain text markdown seems like a no brainer to me!

This site should also be on my [Github](https://github.com/LobsterFestival) too!
