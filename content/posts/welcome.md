Welcome to my personal site! I wanted to do a little bit more web development as I haven't really done much with it since college courses. I was always more of a device and hardware guy, the web was just too nebulous for me to be really interested in programming for. But I am a big fan of fast and efficient programming, something I find the web lacks a great deal of the time. 

Hugo seemed like the perfect technology to learn and explore. I have no need for dynamic content, but wanted a place to call my own that I could share my projects, profile, and still load and render blazing fast.
