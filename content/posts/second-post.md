### You'll Never believe it
Its a second post! This is so the /posts page will have some more content until I figure out how all this Hugo stuff works

Lorem L- just kidding, I'll write some more words so that they appear on the screen. The marvels of modern graphics. I barely know how this site works yet billions of calculations are happening in my PC, (and yours hopefully!) to render that all to spit some photons in your face.

Ok enough words.
